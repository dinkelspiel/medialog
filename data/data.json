The anime can get a little boring at times and thats why it is at a 91 rating and not higher but all the grief and trauma that you can see these characters have went through during the events before the show and then tangling out that mess during the show is really nice to watch i cry every time but i still feel happy after the end. Seeing the most joyful character break down during the last two episodes is really depressing but seing them grow as people during the show even though they are just some characters written by a team of writers is just a nod to how good i think the writing is in this show."}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/AnoHana_DVD_vol_1.jpg/220px-AnoHana_DVD_vol_1.jpg","category":"series"},"sword art online":{"disname":"Sword Art Online","seasons":{"season 1":{"disname":"Season 1","studio":"a1 pictures","rating":81,"notes":"Sword Art Online is based on a good idea. I think executed with a little more planning it would be one of my favourites and while it's still nowhere near mid or lower tier by rating it's definentally lower than it could be because of it's pacing issues that have already been complained about to death so i'm not going to go into it. If you look beyond the pacing issues you have a good show with great animation as is excpected from A1 Pictures and has some of the best fight scenes i have seen in anime which is what carries it. The idea is also amazing and has got me thinking what it would be like to be in real life which is hard to come by because SAO is so fictional yet feels so real in a sense because it's premise is that it's in a game which gets me hopeful that someday we can surpass that and that i can experience SAO for myself. Either way i'd really recommend it to someone not as their first but as a bucketlist watch as it still is a really cool world to see and experience."},"season 2":{"disname":"Season 2","studio":"a1 pictures","rating":-1,"notes":""},"season 3":{"disname":"Season 3","studio":"a1 pictures","rating":-1,"notes":""},"season 4":{"disname":"Season 4","studio":"a1 pictures","rating":-1,"notes":""}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3e/Sword_Art_Online_light_novel_volume_1_cover.jpg/220px-Sword_Art_Online_light_novel_volume_1_cover.jpg","category":"series"},"neon genesis evangelion":{"disname":"Neon Genesis Evangelion","seasons":{"season 1":{"disname":"Season 1","studio":"","rating":83,"notes":"I quite liked Evangelion it has it's charms; up and downs but overall it was a good show. I don't really know about the ending and apparently i'm not alone in feeling that the ending wasn't the best. I felt like i missed an episode explaining what was happening i don't know if i'm just too dense to understand it but it felt like it was at a lower standard than the rest of the show. Speaking of the rest of the show i really enjoyed it. It a mech fighting show in the beginning with some story elements with some mystery looming about that you figured out towards the end which was nice. Going into it i thought it was going to be a numb mech fighting show with a big grand battle at the end which was far from what i got which was a good suprise. I get why so many people find this show to be one of their favourites but i can't really put it up there myself. Maybe it's because i'm watching this in a completely different anime climate than when the show was created because i felt like it would be good to have a little less alien fights as they get abit boring with the Alien Appears -> Evas Engage -> Something Goes Wrong -> They win in the beginning which changes towards the middle when the angels start to appear as if they can evolve which reimbursed my attention for the show. Overall it was a good show but not up there as one of my favourites."}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Evangelion_retouched.png/220px-Evangelion_retouched.png","category":"series"},"your lie in april":{"disname":"Your lie in April","seasons":{"season 1":{"disname":"Season 1","studio":"a1 pictures","rating":98,"notes":"It always a hell of a ride to watch Your lie in April. I believe that I've rewatched it more than 5 times now and I just never get bored. Of course I've left some time between each watch but there's just something that pulls me back into it. The writing, storytelling, the amazing animation, it all comes together to make a show which I hold so close to my heart that I can't explain. I know what will happen and i can map out the story event for event but I always come back to watching it once a year as comfort even when the sadness still creeps in the shadows. There are few shows I've watched where it feels flawless it might be nostalgia but I have watched few shows where I feel like there was no filler or loose plot line. There are also few shows where I can sing the OP without any support which I think shows something. The piano and violin playing is also top notch and I would really like to be able to play like Kousei sometime in my life but I don't think I have it in me. Either way as I've said before one of my favourite anime of all time and a 100% banger."}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Your_Lie_in_April_Manga_cover.png/220px-Your_Lie_in_April_Manga_cover.png","category":"series"},"tokyo ghoul":{"disname":"Tokyo Ghoul","seasons":{"season 1":{"disname":"Season 1","studio":"pierrot","rating":65,"notes":"Works well and is a good introduction to the world.

The characters are well thought out taking into account the length of the show. There isn't much you can develop in 13 episodes apart from the main cast but I feel like it manages enough for me to feel like the characters are hollow shells like some shows have left me feeling.

It really hooked me with the pilot which is something that i don't find very often. As with Attack On Titan which is one of my favourite shows the pilot left me bored and i prolonged me watching it by about a year until i gave it a shot and loved it but Breaking Bad was different it hooked me from the start and kept me watching throught during a single day. The characters are really nicely written and i really like the show. Seeing Walter White and Jesse start their lab and them making good meth while also Walter has cancer and is trying to juggle the meth making with having a family is really cool to watch and i imagine i'll be as hooked for season 2."},"2":{"disname":"2","studio":"","rating":93,"notes":"I really enjoyed season 2. It has the sense of fear that wasn't present in season 1. Tuco in the beginning is honestly terrifying and gave me schills just thinking about him throughout the season. During the episodes you can really see Jesse and Walter evolving as characters and as hardend drug dealers. Seing Walter more and more taking on the persona of Heisenberg is really cool to watch and the scene in the parking lot where he tells of some wannabe meth dealers in Alberquercue is something you would've never seen from Walter in season 1. I also got really sad when Jesse's girlfriend died not because of the character i really in my honest opinion couldn't give less of a fuck about what she was like but seing the father grieve really broke me. I get really hit by seing grieving fathers there was a show that i watched a while back that really made my depressed and it's something i always cry at in shows. I think this season really ramped it up from the first one and i'm excited for season 3."},"3":{"disname":"3","studio":"","rating":78,"notes":"Season 3 of breaking bad was honestly a dissapointment. It took me 4x as much time to watch Season 3 than season 1 and 2 combind which says alot. Character development is important but when it being the whole season which is almost 10 hours it gets really boring and i almost wanted to drop the season all together but pushed through. The uneasy ness of Season 1 and 2 where Walter and Jesse were always in danger is completely gone from season 3 because of the coorporate nature of their job and the stabilization of Walters cancer it just doesn't have the same kick and i love Fring as a character and actor but as a business man hes amazing but he doesn't give the same scare as Tuco gave and it could be Walter White just getting in the character of Heisenberg and being more and more of a hardended criminal but it just doesn't feel the same for me."},"4":{"disname":"4","studio":"","rating":82,"notes":"Breaking bad season 4 was better than season 3 but i cannot say it was anywhere near season 1 or 2. It stems from the fact that it feels like a cat and mouse game and unrealistic. Gus always being 10 steps ahead and the whole season revolving around them needing to kill gus just comes off as annoying because it's meant to give this uneasy feeling but it's just plain boring after 7 hours of this. The mexico arc where they poison all the guards was really cool though and i really liked it."},"5":{"disname":"5","studio":"","rating":85,"notes":"I just finished Season 5 and holy fuck what a show. Honestly i think the whole show wouldv'e been better if the ending of season 5 was instead at season 3 as i believe that 5 seasons was a little too much but maybe that was just because i had burnt out on watching the show as i binged the first three seasons in two weeks which is around 26 hours so i might just have been burnt out but the season 5 finale was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good. Tying up all loose ends was really satisfying and it wasn't bad in the slightest i expected it to be a little more underwhealming but it felt really good and the fact that Jesse was free in the end was nice. Honestly great fucking show and i wouldn't say it has the rewatch value that i would like i think it's because of the length or that it had ALOT of filler which i feel could be cut but i don't see it as wasted time as i have with some other shows. Either way final verdict of the entire series is that i really really liked it but i can't really say that i would rewatch it in the near future. Can't say if it's because of the filler or the length i think it's the first option as i have rewatched Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood a show which has a similar length about 4 times and i have loved it each time which makes it so that i will need to dock some points from breaking bad but i still really loved it."}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Breaking_Bad_logo.svg/250px-Breaking_Bad_logo.svg.png","category":"series"},"gravity falls":{"disname":"Gravity Falls","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"Disney","rating":81,"notes":"Gravity Falls season 1 is a classic disney show. It follows the style of similar shows such as Phineas and Pherb with the episodic story structure rather than a coherent plot throughout the show as i would prefer. I am not the target audience though and regarding the fact that most of the people that will be watching gravity falls will be 12 year olds during summer where they will watch max half of the episodes that are produced then it makes sense. I am largely intreagued by the plot of Ford and Bill Cipher throughout the show and it's what keeps me going watching but i don't think that i would watch Gravity Falls nowadays if i hadn't had previous experiences with it at a younger age as the first season doesn't really develop the characters other than Dippers love for Wendy and their collective hate for Gideon. I still think season 1 is good just not for me. I rewatch the show for season 2 as thats when the show becomes good in my opinion as Gravity Falls is only presented as wierd in season 1 not anything special just a random town with a crazy mayor and some gnomes. Either way i still love the show and the characters in it and it doesn't feel that dumbed down compared to some shows as it still feels down to earth and the characters relations although appropriated for Disney Channel still feel decent and i still adore the

Looking forward to watching Season 2."}},"cover_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVmMmM5ZmItZDg0OC00NTFiLWIxNzctZjNmYTY5OTU3ZWU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","category":"series"},"a whisker away":{"disname":"A Whisker Away","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"toho","rating":-1,"notes":""}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/df/Nakitai_Watashi_wa_Neko_o_Kaburu_poster.png/220px-Nakitai_Watashi_wa_Neko_o_Kaburu_poster.png","category":"movie"},"the girl who leapt through time":{"disname":"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"madhouse","rating":-1,"notes":""}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/Toki_o_Kakeru_Sh%C5%8Djo_1976_book_cover.jpg","category":"movie"},"akira":{"disname":"Akira","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"tokyo movie shisha","rating":-1,"notes":""}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5d/AKIRA_%281988_poster%29.jpg","category":"movie"},"when marnie was there":{"disname":"When Marnie Was There","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"studio ghibli","rating":-1,"notes":""}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a7/When_Marnie_Was_There.png/220px-When_Marnie_Was_There.png","category":"movie"},"ocean waves":{"disname":"Ocean Waves","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"studio ghibli","rating":-1,"notes":""}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/Umigakikoeru_poster.jpg","category":"movie"},"flavours of youth":{"disname":"Flavours of Youth","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"comix wave films","rating":-1,"notes":""}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Flavors_of_Youth_poster.jpeg/220px-Flavors_of_Youth_poster.jpeg","category":"movie"},"wolf children":{"disname":"Wolf children","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"studio chizu","rating":95,"notes":"One of my favourite animes of all time.

It's really unique and I haven't seen any other anime do it the same way and the characters are really likeable which is why it is one of my favourites.

The colors and the depth and the beautiful overall style is gorgeous. I really liked the story too and the whole movie makes this easily one of my favourite movies. The characters in the movie are believable and that's what I'm looking for in fiction. I want the characters to feel real i want to be able to submerge myself in the world that the studio is trying to create and this has to be one of the best ones ive seen and the underworld element was a pleasant surprise as i expected something closer to Your Name but it exceeded my expectations and im absolutely in love with everything the world has to offer. Having the arcangels aspect of the movie be in was also really worked in the movies favour as i expected it to be like we go to the underworld yay but the fact that they literally kill a god with weapons makes it pop and makes it stand out from the rest as it really feels like the real world.

I think the movie was pretty good the animation was good and the characters felt kinda one dimensional and the lack off team rocket interference is to be expected as its a movie but still i find that the movie was pretty entertaining and sad at times for example at the Luxio part (idk if that was the name) which actually made me cry abit. It wasn't anything major but it was a sad scene that was well setup and was a good part of Sorrels backstory that gives us good insight on who he is. Cross as a character felt like a one sided villain of the story and didn't really have any traits aside from strength good friendship bad but ill let it pass as it is a childrens pokemon movie. The plot also felt a little dull with the only driving factor being lets go to the mountain to meet hoho and yeah i guess that the movie can't build up that much during 100 minute runtime but it can be done and at least some side plots as it was kind of boring at times. Either way a pretty mediocre movie that has its moments."}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/Pok%C3%A9mon_episode_1_screenshot.png","category":"movie"},"liz and the blue bird":{"disname":"Liz and the blue bird","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"kyoani","rating":82,"notes":"I'm really split on this film as i really enjoyed it and it's really beautiful as expected from a KyoAni film but i also felt like it was dragged out but also not?

I'm probably gonna rewatch it and love it but it was a bit dragged out imo. But i cant understate how much i like the writing around Mizore and Nozomi although they fell apart i always felt like they had this invisible thread and i cant FUCKING EXXAGARATE how much i liked the last scene in the lab where they hug.

Honey Lemon and/or Go Go are my favourite characters in the movie and i just think that they are really cool and i would really like to see a sequel but kinda not.

I think it's with good reason that this movie has such a high rating as it has both on IMDB and here as it is truly an amazing piece of art and has some of the best acting and storytelling that i have ever seen which really will make it hard to appreciate a movie as The Shawshank Redemption has set such a high standard for movies to come that i will watch.

It's downfall comes from it only having moviefied the first volume which ends it on a cliffhanger with no sequel in sight which is the problem that arises when a manga is made into a movie instead of a one season show which can encapsulate all volumes into a shorter anime. Talking about the movie looking over the fact that it isn't technically finished makes it a really enjoyeable movie. It does have a semi sex scene close to the one in Bloom into you where it is short and more to enhance the plot rather than the actual scene and it shows their imperfections and their characters and i do believe that the movie would be worse off without it as it builds on the characters. The scenery and the character design is absolutely beautiful and it's always nice to watch a movie from a studio that you haven't heared of before and to be genuinely suprised. The characters writing is ofcourse not sources by the movie but it's still impeccable and the sister and her girlfriend are a really cute couple and i really enjoy scenes when they are in them while they tease Shun about Mio and they are incredibly well written. I can't say that i will put this movie above some in the 90's but it sits comfortably in 89 and i will have to read the manga because i need to know what happens next in the story."}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/L%27%C3%A9tranger_du_Plage_cover.jpg/220px-L%27%C3%A9tranger_du_Plage_cover.jpg","category":"movie"},"detachment ":{"disname":"Detachment ","seasons":{},"category":"movie","cover_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NzQzMDA5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA5NTcyNw@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg"},"good will hunting":{"disname":"Good Will Hunting","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"","rating":81,"notes":"Good will hunting was a good movie. It wasn't anything groundbreaking for me and i cannot say that the movie is one of my favourites as i didn't really think about it after and it felt kind of above mediocre in my books. If i compare it to a movie of a similar nature like Dead Poets Society and Shawshank Redemption then it falls short ofcourse these are movie revered and it's tough competition but the fact that it doesn't match those standards means that i cannot put it above a 85. It is however a stunning movie and i enjoyed it throughout it wasnt a movie i skipped parts of because they were boring it was just nothing special. The acting and cinematography was good though and its well written and maybe it's just not for me."}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/52/Good_Will_Hunting.png/220px-Good_Will_Hunting.png","category":"movie"},"intouchables":{"disname":"En Oväntad Vänskap","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"","rating":-1,"notes":""}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/The_Intouchables.jpg","category":"movie"},"to kill a mockingbird":{"disname":"To Kill a Mockingbird","seasons":{"1":{"disname":"1","studio":"","rating":82,"notes":"This was a really good movie.

The story was however really good and i really enjoyed it paints a picture of early 20th century USA and it's a really good watch. The pacing is a little slow by modern standards but its excpected being 60 years old this year.

I really liked the characters and although I usually avoid cutesy cafe manga/anime stuff since I usually find them annoying, since Fukakai na boku. focuses more on the relations between the characters and had major scenes outside of the cafe. I found that it strengthened the story rather than making it bloated with nyan uwu stuff. Also i have to talk about the elephant in the room which is Mogumo and the other characters like Satori because hgnnnnnn they pass so well and id be lying if i wasnt a bit envious still cis tho. Mogumo is just so cute with their hair up and in one of the later chapters when Sakura helps style them i got really envious because of ze cuteness but i also got some stuff i'm worrying about in the show since im prolly mtf let's be honest future me and this made me reflect on how coming out as a fellow tomato might disrupt my future life but i'd hope if you are reading this you already have like id hope so wanna go on hrt before 2030. Either way if i'm not a tomato and i'm writing this in vain i hope you had a nice laugh of how much i'm stressing rn. But either way it was a really good manga and the characters are well written and cutely drawn like I mentioned when Mogumo got dressed by Sakura and I'm probably gonna read the sequel sometime later.

Ofcourse it is a comic which gives it alot less space than a normal book with a dialogue being one page instead of one paragraph but i really enjoyed it. I read it in about 40-45 minutes and was hooked all the way through and i really loved the character development throught and seing Charlie become friends with Nick and them being really cute togeher was reallllly cute and i wish i could read it again for the first time.

I read it just as fast as the first volume and it still feels short. Ofcourse this is excpected of a comic book as they have the words a normal book can write in two chapters on a whole book but it's still finominal. Where the first book shows Nick and Charlie become close friends and then kissing in the end which builds up throughout the book. To volume 2 where they are a private couple at first and it's really sweet seeing them both together. The middle of the book was by far my favourite when they start being really sweet with eachother and when they have their first real 'date' on the beach which is my favourite 'scene' so far. I will definentaly read volume 3 as fast as i can get my hands on it as i really want to get to read what happens next which isn't something that i really do with books so great job!"}},"cover_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Heartstopper_title-card.png/250px-Heartstopper_title-card.png","category":"book"},"death troopers":{"disname":"Death Troopers","seasons":{},"category":"book","cover_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519N8frZJzL._AC_SY780_.jpg"},"rick and morty":{"disname":"Rick and Morty","cover_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU1MzAyNzUtY2FlZi00YTg1LTg2OGQtZjZjYzg3YWVlNGMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb2Njbw@@._V1_.jpg","category":"series","seasons":{"season 1":{"disname":"Season 1","rating":79,"studio":"Adult Swim","notes":"Season 1 was about what i expected.
